Project description: Singleton Design Pattern
This project makes use of the singleton design pattern to implement a ChessBoard class.

To play
-------
The chessboard squares are numbered as follows: 11 to 18, 21 to 28 ... 81 to 88
Black pawns are at 11 to 18 and 21 to 28. 
White pawns are at 71 to 78 and 81 to 88.
Enter the appropriate square number to move the pawn.
The game will run until user enters 0 to signal gameover. 

Building the executable:
Make sure that all the .h and .cpp files are in the same folder as the supplied Makefile.
make - builds target "run", using g++ compiler.
make clang- builds target "run", using clang compiler.
make clean - removes executable and other object files.

Files:
1. main.cpp - Contains main function with gameloop. Enter zeroes to exit the game.
2. chess.h - Contains declarations of the singleton ChessBoard class.
3. chess.cpp - Contains definitions of the ChessBoard class.
4. player.h - Contains declarations of the Player class. Includes methods to validate moves. 
5. player.cpp - Contains the definitions of the Player class.
6. README - This file
